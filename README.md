## Questions

Q1: What is Document Object Model (DOM)?

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the struct of a document as a tree of object, making it possible for programming languages such as JavaScript to interact with, manipulate, and update the content, structure, and style of a document dynamically.

For instance, consider the table, taken from an HTML document:

```html
<table>
  <ROWS>
    <tr>
      <td>Shady Grove</td>
      <td>Aeolian</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Over the River, Charlie</td>
      <td>Dorian</td>
    </tr>
  </ROWS>
</table>
```

The Document Object Model represents this table like this:

Why DOM is important?

- DOM allow web pages to be interactive. By manipulating the DOM, developer can create dynamic web application that response to user input.
- With DOM, developer can use familiar programming languages like JavaScript to access and modify web pages.
- DOM is standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), ensuring a consistent approach across different browsers and platforms.

Q2: How React or Vue can manipulate DOM?
